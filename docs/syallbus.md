### Topics

 - Logistics
 - Scheduling
 - Class Format
 - Intro to Git & GitHub

### Materials
 - [Using Git](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
 - [Markdown (GitHub flavored)](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)

### Homework
1. Create a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account
2. Learn the basics of git & GitHub by completing the following steps:
  - to get a visual of how git works, complete the first 3 lessons of the Introduction Sequence at [Learning Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) (Introduction to Git Commits, Branching in Git, Merging in Git)
  - follow the installation instructions for [Git-it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron##what-to-install) (Mac/Windows available), this includes the installation of a GitHub GUI with command line tools and a text editor of your choice (suggested are [Atom](atom/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), both are excellent and will do the job, just read their websites and decide which resonates best with you)
  - start Git-It on your desktop and complete the entire program to learn git configuration, working with repositories, commits, forks, branches, GitHub remotes, and an actual collaboration exercise.
3. Join the Introductory Group exercise on GitHub Classroom by following [this link](https://classroom.github.com/g/laiMXd9w) and picking the already existing group `class` (we'll all work together on this one)
4. Complete the exercise outlined in the README of the [group repository](https://github.com/2018-Computational-Tools/group-info-class)  (only accessible after you've joined in the previous step)
5. In preparation for next class, install the following software on your computer (you don't have to use it yet, we just want you to be ready to dive straight in at the beginning of class):
  - [Python 3 & Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) (easiest by following the recommendation to install anaconda)
  - [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/##download)
